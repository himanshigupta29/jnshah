    Today in this dynamic world children need to be made aware of the moral values and value of primary greatness or goodness in their character. A child is the most valuable in any country. Every child holds the promise of a bright future for his family, society, and country, and the world, provided he/she is armed with education, skills, and human values.

  <p>
    Education is incomplete without moral values. Moral values begin in the family The mother is the childâ€™s first teacher. J N Shah endeavors to inculcate in its children the value of discipline, courage, and willpower, which are the essential values of every person and helps to create a life rich in passion, inspiration, possibility, and peace.
